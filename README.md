# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose:

In this module, I used Leaflet and GeoJSON data to map earthquakes and tectonic plates around the world. In the earthquakes_challenge folder you can run the scripts that show
this. Three overlay maps are provided, one for earthquakes in the past 7 days, one for the tectonic plates and one for major earthquakes. Three base maps are also provided.
